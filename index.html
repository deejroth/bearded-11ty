<h1>Welcome...</h1>

<p>Hi. I'm DeeJ. I'm a Web developer, soccer coach & keeper, hockey player, and a dude. Also,
    lover of funny things and fun times. I enjoy volunteering for youth activities, reading to
    elementary schools, helping kids be their best, and making people laugh. When not doing all
    of that, you can find me at my day job; making fuel line components for the aerospace
    industry.</p>

<p>You can find me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram as @deejroth.</p>

<p>Here's a list of blogs I currently run and sites I work on...</p>
